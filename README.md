## Name suggestions

  - **provisional name**: JuKuCMS
  - Falcon CMS (falcons are the fastest animals in the world)
  - RocketCMS (as fast as a rocket - the fastest vehicle on the earth)
  - WarpCMS (suggested by @PascalReintjens)
  - HyperspeedCMS (suggested by @PascalReintjens)

## Main Goals

I am one of the earlier developers of [ContentLion](http://contentlion.org) and now i want to build a new - very fast - CMS (Content Management System).\
My favorite CMS is wordpress, but it has a really big problem: Its very slow.\
I think Wordpress is the best, but also the slowest CMS (also with Cache plugins), because it depends on the software & plugin architecture.\
So i try to make it better! Build a fast CMS with all required features by default, but also very extenable.\
**Main goal**: Reach a performance that CMS can **generate pages in <= 200ms**.

  - fastest CMS in then world
  - scalable
  - supports Memcache
  - based on newest technologies (PHP7 and so on)
  - SEO / search engine friendly by default
  - WYSIWYG Editor (What You See Is What You Get, like Word)
  - support for Blog & ticket (support) systems
  - self repair (if database is broken, this CMS should be able to repair the database itself without any manuall interactions)
  - extendable
  - mobile friendly
  - get high Google page speed score
  - plugin marketplace (only checked plugins!) with speed index (how much they reduce speed of cms)
  
## Requirements

  - PHP 7.0.8+
  - MySQL 5.7+
  - Mod_Rewrite Support
